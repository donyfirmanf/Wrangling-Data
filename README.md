# Data Wrangling

Hello! Welcome to the Data Wrangling repository.

Within this repository, you'll find my Data Wrangling Test undertaken at a company in Indonesia.

I've encountered three datasets, each with a distinct format (CSV, JSON, .SQL). My primary task involves converting these datasets, followed by the essential steps of data wrangling and cleaning.

Special thanks to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-json-to-csv-in-python/ for providing valuable guidance on converting JSON to CSV. Additionally, I want to express my gratitude to Yashsmehta for sharing a repository (https://github.com/yashsmehta/mysqldump-to-csv) that assisted me in converting .SQL dumps to CSV.

For those interested, I've also created a Tableau dashboard showcasing the processed data: [XYZ Business Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/XYZBussinessDashboard/XYZBussinessDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

Thank you for visiting! I hope this repository proves helpful and meaningful to fellow GitHub users. Feel free to explore and provide feedback.

Best regards,
